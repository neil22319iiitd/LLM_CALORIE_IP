# Combining the Files

The first python script processes and combines multiple CSV files from the **RecipeDB** database to create a unified dataset. It merges information from ingredient details, nutritional data, regional classifications, and cooking instructions into a single file named `final_combined_file.csv`.

The script groups ingredient-related fields, merges them with metadata like calories and region, and finally appends cooking instructions. The result is a consolidated dataset, ready for further analysis
